    <h1>GOLDEN PHEASANT CHARACTERISTICS</h1>
        <p>Male and female Golden Pheasants look different in appearance. Males measure 90 – 105 centimetres in
            length with the tail making up two thirds of the total length. Females are slightly smaller measuring
            60 – 80 centimetres in length with the tail making up half of the total length. Their wingspan is around 
            70 centimetres and they weigh around 630 grams.</p>
        <p>Male Golden Pheasants can be easily identified by their bright colouring. They have a golden crest tipped 
            with red which extends from the top of their heads, down their necks. They have bright red underparts, 
            dark coloured wings and a pale brown, long, barred tail. Their rumps are also golden, upper backs are 
            green and they have bright yellow eyes with a small black pupil. Their face, throat and chin are a rust 
            colour and their wattles and orbital skin are yellow. Beak, legs and feet are also yellow.</p>
        <p>Female Golden Pheasants are less colourful and more duller than males. They have a mottled brown plumage, 
            pale brown face, throat, breast and sides, pale yellow feet and are more slender in appearance.</p>
